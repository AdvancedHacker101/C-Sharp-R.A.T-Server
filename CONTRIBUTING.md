It's very simple!

3. Issue a pull request  
4. I will do a merge after verifying (in some cases changing) the code

You can simply use the *Issues* section on github  
Just write an issue, and i will try to respond within 24 hours!  
## How to contribute? (without writing code)
You can also do this on the *Issues* section, and i will label it as *enhancement*  
This way you can suggest new features, or change an older one without coding.  
I will try to respond within 24 hours!  
## How to run / compile
I use Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.  
The program is written in c\# and built with .NET Framework 4.5  
Any additional requirements can be found under TutServer/bin/debug  
## How to ask questions?
You can also use the *Issues* section on GitHub, i will assign a label to it, so it's different from bugs.
